- The current approach has a `main.py` that's at about 500 lines. Let's break up the functions into modules in an intelligent way and import them into the main script.
- In the `person` table, the "birth_date" and "death_date" fields are currently string type and have an unpredictable format. We should rename these as "birth_date_string" and "death_date_string", then try to convert the string to a true date format as best as possible. The date format result (if available) should be stored in new fields called "birth_date" and "death_date". If a string can't be parsed, leave it as null in these new date format fields. Here are some examples of date strings you can expect:
    - "25 NOV 1954"
    - "1698"
    - "ABOUT 1905"
    - "JAN 1905"
    - "(01-27-1920)"
    - "(02 May1838)"
    - "(04 05 1911)"
    - "(05/15/1923)"
    - "(06-06-1884)"
    - "(08 March 1893)"
    - "(1/15/1957)"
    - "(11 Aug. 1968)"
    - "(Abt.  1798)"
    - "(April 1817)"
    - "(April 17, 1850)"
    - "(about 1833)"
